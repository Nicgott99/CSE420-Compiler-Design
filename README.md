1. **Lexical Analyzer** - Tokenization and pattern recognition
2. **Syntax Analyzer** - Grammar parsing and parse tree generation
3. **Semantic Analyzer** - Scope-aware symbol table management and type checking

## 🚀 Current Progress

### ✅ Assignment 2 — Lexical & Syntax Analysis (COMPLETED)
- [x] **Lexical Analyzer** — Complete Flex implementation with 18+ keywords
- [x] **Syntax Analyzer** — Full Bison grammar with C-like language support
- [x] **Symbol Management** — Three-tier architecture (`symbol_info`, `scope_table`, `symbol_table`)
- [x] **Hash Tables** — Efficient symbol storage with collision resolution
- [x] **Error Handling** — Comprehensive error reporting with line numbers
- [x] **Test Suite** — 3 comprehensive test cases covering all functionality
- [x] **Build System** — Professional Makefile with automated testing
- [x] **Documentation** — Complete technical documentation and contribution guides

> See [Assignment-2/README.md](Assignment-2/README.md) for full details.

### ✅ Assignment 3 — Semantic Analysis & Symbol Table Management (COMPLETED)
- [x] **Scope-Aware Symbol Table** — Hierarchical scope manager with stack-based enter/exit
- [x] **Type Checking** — Full type propagation through expression trees
- [x] **Semantic Errors** — 11 distinct error categories (undeclared variables/functions, type mismatches, duplicate declarations, void operations, zero division, etc.)
- [x] **Function Validation** — Argument count and type checking on every call site
- [x] **Return Type Validation** — Checked against the enclosing function's declared type
- [x] **Parse Log** — Detailed `22101371_log.txt` with every production rule applied
- [x] **Error Report** — Dedicated `22101371_error.txt` with line numbers and error totals
- [x] **MIT License** — Open-source license included

> See [Assignment-3/README.md](Assignment-3/README.md) for full details.

### ⏳ Upcoming
- [ ] **Assignment 4** — Intermediate Code Generation (Three-Address Code)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Flex** — Fast lexical analyzer generator
- **Bison** — Parser generator (LALR(1))
- **C++** — Implementation language
- **GNU Make** — Build automation

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

```bash
# --- Assignment 2 ---
cd Assignment-2
make
make test

# --- Assignment 3 ---
cd Assignment-3
make
make test
# Outputs: 22101371_log.txt, 22101371_error.txt
```
